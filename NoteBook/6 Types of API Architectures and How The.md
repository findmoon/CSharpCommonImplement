APIs connect applications through clear protocols and architectures. An API architecture is a framework of rules for creating software interfaces. The rules determine how to provide server functionality to users. The type of architecture determines the rules and structures that govern the API.

There are many different types of API architecture, from REST to RPC. Learning about their structure and composition will help you select one for your application.

## 1\. REST

[REST APIs](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-rest-api/) are modern and are the most popular API architecture that developers use. **REST** (representational state transfer) is an architecture used to design client-server applications. It's not a protocol or standard, so you can implement it in various ways. This aspect increases your flexibility as a developer.

  

REST allows access to the requested data stored in a database. You can perform the core CRUD functions with a REST API. When clients request content via a RESTful API, they must use the right headers and parameters. Headers contain useful metadata to identify a resource, like status codes and authorization.

The information transferred via HTTP can be in JSON, HTML, XML, or plain text. JSON is the most commonly used file format for REST APIs. JSON is language-agnostic and readable by humans.

## 2\. SOAP

[Simple object access protocol](https://www.makeuseof.com/soap-vs-rest-api-what-are-the-differences/) (SOAP) is an official API protocol. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) maintains the SOAP protocol, which is one of the earliest API architectures. Its design eases communication between applications built with different languages and platforms.

The SOAP format describes an API using the web service description language (WSDL). It's written in the extensive markup language (XML). The format imposes built-in compliance standards that boost security, consistency, isolation, and durability. These properties ensure reliable database transactions making SOAP better for enterprise development.

  

When a user requests content through a SOAP API, it goes through the standard layer protocols. The response is in XML format, which humans and machines can read. Like REST APIs, SOAP APIs don't cache /store information. If you need the data later, you need to make another request.

SOAP supports both stateful and stateless data exchanges.

## 3\. GraphQL

[GraphQL is a query language](https://www.makeuseof.com/graphql-rest-http-alternative/) for an API. It's a server-side runtime that executes queries based on a defined set of data. GraphQL has specific use cases. Its architecture allows you to declare the specific information you need.

Unlike in REST architecture, where HTTP handles the client requests and responses, GraphQL requests data with queries. A GraphQL service defines the types and fields of those types, then provides functions for each field and type.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT3'); });

  

The service receives [GraphQL queries](https://graphql.org/learn/) to validate and execute. First, it checks a query to ensure it refers to the defined types and fields defined. Then, it runs the associated functions to produce the desired result.

GraphQL is great for certain use cases like fetching data from multiple sources. You can also control data fetching and regulate the bandwidth for smaller devices.

## 4\. Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed platform that supports event streaming. Event streaming is the process of capturing data in real time from sources. The Sources can be databases, servers, or software applications. The Kafka system consists of servers and clients. Communication happens through a TCP network protocol.

You can deploy the system on hardware, virtual machines, and containers. You can do this on-premise and in cloud environments. Apache Kafka system captures data, processes, and reacts to it in real time. It can also route the data to a preferred destination in real time. Kafka captures and stores data in the system which you can retrieve later for use.

Kafka supports a continuous flow and integration of data. This ensures that information is at the right place, at the right time. Event streaming can apply to many use cases that need live data streams. These include financial institutions, health care, government, the transport industry, and computer software companies.

## 5\. AsyncAPI

[AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) is an open-source initiative that helps build and maintain event-driven architectures. Its specifications have many things in common with the OpenAPI specs. AsyncAPI is essentially an adaptation from, and improvement of, OpenAPI specs, with a few differences.

The AsyncAPI architecture brings together a mixture of REST APIs and event-driven APIs. Its schemas for handling requests and responses are similar to that of event APIs. AsyncAPI provides specifications to describe and document asynchronous applications in a machine-readable format. It also provides tools like code generators to make it easier for users to implement them.

  

AsyncAPI improves the current state of Event-Driven architecture (EDA). The goal is to make it easier to work with EDAs as it is with REST APIs. The AsyncAPI initiative provides documentation and code, that support event management. The majority of the processes used in REST APIs apply to event-driven/asynchronous APIs.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT5'); });

Using the AsyncAPI specification to document event-driven systems is vital. It governs and maintains consistency and efficiency across teams working on event-driven projects.

## 6\. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

RPC is a software communication protocol that allows communication between different programs on a network. For example, a program can request information from another computer on the network. It does not have to adhere to network protocols. You can use RPC to call processes on remote systems just like on the local system.

RPC operates on the client-server model. The client program requests and the server program responds with a service. RPCs operate on synchrony. When a program sends a request, it remains suspended until it receives a response from the server.

  

RPCs are best for distributed systems. They are best for command-based systems and have lightweight payloads that increase performance.

## How to Choose the Right API Architecture

The right API architecture depends on your use case. The architecture determines the methodology to develop the API and how it will run. The architectural design of the API defines its components and interactions.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT6'); });

Make architectural decisions before designing and developing the API. Determine the technical requirements of the API, the tier, lifecycle management, and security. API architecture designs contain structural layers. The layers guide development and ensure the API created serves its intended purpose.
