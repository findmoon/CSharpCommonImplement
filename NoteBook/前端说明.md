Modern computers are equipped with a lot of storage space and memory and are quite fast in their operations. But sometimes, a small problem here or there could lead to the slowing down of a computer. One of the main reasons for this is a memory leak.

But what exactly is a memory link, and how does it happen? Can you do anything to resolve this issue? Let's take a look.

window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { $vvvInit('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable1-5f42160cbd920c', 'MUO\_Video\_Desktop', \['https://video.adsninja.ca/valnetinc/MakeUseOf/63eede1942350-projectRssVideoFile.mp4', 'https://video.adsninja.ca/valnetinc/MakeUseOf/63f7d368607ff-projectRssVideoFile.mp4', 'https://video.adsninja.ca/valnetinc/MakeUseOf/63f7d3a0273d6-projectRssVideoFile.mp4', 'https://video.adsninja.ca/valnetinc/MakeUseOf/63f7d4145084e-projectRssVideoFile.mp4', 'https://video.adsninja.ca/valnetinc/MakeUseOf/63eed8ec22b2e-projectRssVideoFile.mp4'\]) })

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-connectedBelowAd-5f4216389a0bf8'); });

## What Is a Memory Leak?

Computer memory is temporarily stored and retrieved from [random access memory (RAM)](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-clear-memory-increase-ram-windows-computer/) for running various applications.

A memory leak is a portion of an application that uses memory from RAM without finally freeing it. The result is that an app crashes the next time it attempts to use more memory, which can impact on the performance of a computer.

## How to Detect a Memory Leak

When the system undergoes a shortage of memory, you are most likely to receive an on-screen warning message along the lines of "running out of memory.: The performance starts degrading and the system begins malfunctioning.

You can find a memory leak by looking at your system’s RAM usage. Running the Windows Performance Monitor can help find a memory leak. You won't find the source of leakage using this method, but it will help you investigate whether a memory link exists.

To run the Performance monitor, hold **Windows Key + R** simultaneously to open the **Run** command. Then, enter **mdsched.exe**.

After that, click **OK** and select **Restart Now** to check problems. The test will start and may take several hours to complete. Follow the on-screen instructions after the completion of the test to detect memory leaks.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT2'); });

## The Consequences of Memory Leaks

Consequences depend on the use of client or server applications. The extent of these is listed below.

### Client Applications (Desktops and Mobile Phones)

For these, the consequences are not very serious, as the memory allocated is released when the application is terminated. So, there is no system instability. Some problems encountered by excessive memory usage can be:

- Your system may begin slowing down.
- Apps on your computer might close abruptly.
- The computer's application code allocating memory can crash and cause bugs.

### Server Applications

The problem of memory leakage gets worse in this case, as the server has to run for a long time without restarting. The problems here are the same as those in the case of desktop applications. The memory is consumed over days, weeks, months, and the server performance starts degrading. Bugs start to appear, causing the server to stop working eventually.

## How to Prevent a Memory Leak

Most programming languages today are included with features to assist developers with automatic memory management. They use a system called **Garbage Collector**, which helps in freeing up memory that is not in use. There are various types of garbage collectors, and understanding how your application’s garbage collector functions is an important step in preventing memory leaks.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT3'); });

Another method to prevent memory leakage is by writing a code that disposes of unneeded resources. You will be required to write specific code indicating the application that the resource’s work has finished, and there is no further memory use. Ensure that loops are executed completely to avoid memory leak occurrence.

Sometimes, you may need to restart the system to prevent a memory leak. However, doing this can impact open apps. This is therefore the least recommended option, and you should close all apps if you resort to this.

## How to Fix a Memory Leak in Windows

Memory leaks may be hard to detect and fix at an early stage of development. However, some of the recommended methods of fixing memory leaks are:

### Ending a Program Using the Most Memory

One of the best methods to prevent memory leaks is to terminate the program that is using most of the computer's memory.

Press **CTRL + Shift + ESC** keys to start **Task Manager.** Under the **Process** tab, find a program using most of the memory. Now, right-click the program to **End Task** and close this program. Restart your PC and you will find that the memory leak has been wiped off.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT4'); });

  

## ​​​​Using Windows 10 Built-In Tools

Windows 10 has a built-in diagnostics tool to provide accurate analysis in determining the main cause of the problem.

Go to **Search**, type **Windows Memory Diagnostic** and click it.

  

After that, choose **Restart now** to check for problems. The tool will scan your PC for memory issues, including leakage, and provide you with results for the problems detected.

  

You can also take the help of a built-in app in Windows 10 known as a **Resource Monitor** to understand the memory leakage problem. Go to **Search**, type **Resource Monitor**, and open it. By clicking **Resource Monitor**, you can view the real-time data of your system. Analyze the cause of the problem and fix it accordingly.

  

### Adjusting Your PC for the Best Performance

Windows allows you to adjust the setting of your PC with the best performance option.

Right-click your desktop and go to **Personalize**. In the new window, type **Advanced System Settings** in the search bar.

  

After completing the above steps, go to the **Advanced tab** and click **Settings** under **Performance**.

  

After that, check the **Adjust for Best Performance** option. Click OK and restart your PC. Your PC is now set to provide you with the best performance.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT5'); });

  

## ​​How to Disable Programs Running on Start-Up

Sometimes there is a program running on start-up causing a memory leak. To deal with this problem, it is required to disable the app to ensure that it causes no more problems at the start-up.

Press **CTRL + SHIFT + ESC** keys to open **Task Manager** and click the **Startup** tab.

  

Screenshot

In the new window, find the program you don’t want to run with a PC start-up. The task manager also shows which program is leaking memory. Simply disable it to prevent any memory leakage. Click the program and choose **Disable**. Finally, restart your PC.

  

### Defragmenting Hard Drives

Besides optimizing the computer’s hard disk, defragmentation results in amazing memory management. On your desktop, click **This PC.** Right-click the hard drive you want to defragment (most likely C) and select **Properties**.

  

Afterward, select the **Tools** tab and under **Optimize and Defragment Drive**, click **Optimize**. Wait for the process to finish. Restart to save changes.

  

### How to Disable Runtime Broker

Disabling Runtime Broker is the process of managing permissions of Microsoft apps on your PC. Usually, Runtime Brokers use a small amount of memory, but in case of a faulty app, the process can significantly slow down your PC.

googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('adsninja-ad-unit-characterCountRepeatable-636c2cc1cf2a8-REPEAT6'); });

First, press the **CTRL + SHIFT + ESC** keys to open **Task Manager** and scroll down to find **Runtime Broker**.

  

Right-click it and **Disable/End Task**.

  

### Disabling Windows Tips and Tricks

Tips and Tricks offered by Windows 10 are useful for new users. They guide the users to effectively use the system and assist them with some additional useful options.

Go to the **Start Menu** of your system and open **Settings**.

  

In the new window, under **System**, select and click **Notifications** **& actions** on the left panel.

  

After completing the steps listed above, find **Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows** and uncheck it.

  

Unchecking this option will confirm that you don't receive messages from Windows. However, you can reverse this option by checking it if you want suggestions from Windows.
